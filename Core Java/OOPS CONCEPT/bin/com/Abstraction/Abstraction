@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ ABSTRACTION @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

    -Abstraction:abstraction is a process of hiding the internal
    implementation details from the user, and only show the functionality 
     to the user. 
     i.e user only know what object do how it is doing user dont know.
     -we can not create the object of abstract class but in case of anonymous
     inner class we can create class object.
     -we can not crate object becz its partially implemented class which 
     having the partially method which has no complete implementation like 
     concreate method so thats why jvm dont allows us to create the object;
     -static method is also present inside abstract method.
     
     Advantage:
    - The advantage of using an abstract class is that you can group several 
     related classes together as siblings. Grouping classes together is 
     important in keeping a program organized and understandable.
     -Abstract classes enable code reusability.
     -Abstract class in Java is highly beneficial in writing shorter codes
     -Abstraction in Java avoids code duplication.
     -Changes to internal code implementation are done without affecting classes
     
     
     Q.why abstract class have constructor as we dont create the object.
     ANS-to initialize the the instance variable and constructor chaining is always
     happens
