 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PACKAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
  -Pkg is a container which having group of similar type of classes ,Interfaces and sub-pkg 
  -There are two types
   1)Built in pkg(java.sql,java.io,java.lang)
   2)User defined pkg.(our own pkg)
   
   ADVANTAGES OF JAVA PKG
   1)Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.
   2)Java package provides access protection.
   3)Java package removes naming collision.
   
   EX                           JAVA         ---------------------------------pkg name
   
              java.lang         java.util        java.awt  ------------------sub pkg   
    
   system.class  String.Class   ArrayList          Button.Class--------------Classes
   
   -WHEN EVER you need to compile pkg use javac -d
   
   
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ENCAPSULATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
  -Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit 
  -The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.
  
  #  ADVANTAGES
  1)It provides you the CONTROL OVER THE DATA. Suppose you want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only,
   you can write the logic inside the setter method. You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers in the 
   setter methods.

  2)It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private 
  data members.

  3)The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.
  4)The standard IDE's are providing the facility to generate the getters and setters. So, it is easy and fast to 
    create an encapsulated class in Java.
