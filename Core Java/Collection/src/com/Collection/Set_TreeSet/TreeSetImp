TREE SET(C)
-IF YOU WANT TO REPRESENT GROUP OF INDIVIDUAL OBJECT AS A SINGLE ENTITY WHERE DUPLICATES ARE NOT ALLOWED
AND OBJECT ARE INSERTED BASED ON SOME SORTING ALGORITHM THEN WE SHOULD GO FOR TREE SET.


@ THE UNDERLYING DATA STRUCTURE FOR TREE SET IS BALANCED TREE
-DUPLICATES ARE NOT ALLOWED ,INSERTION ORDER BASED ON DEFAULT NATURAL SORTING OR CUSTOMIZED SORTING
-NULL INSERTION NOT ALLOWED OTHERWISE "CCE" OCCURE
-SUPPORT ONLY HOMOGENIOUS OBJECT.

@CONSTRUCTOR
1)TREESET TS=NEW TREESET();//CREATE EMPTY TREESET WITH DEFAULT NATURAL SORTING
2)TREESET TS=NEW TREESET(COMPARATOR C);//CREATE EMPTY TREE SET OF CUSTOMIZED SORTING BY OBJECT OF COMPARATOR
3)TREESET TS=NEW TREESET(COLLECTION C);
4)TREESET TS=NEW TREESET(SORTEDSET S);

@SPECIAL METHOD 
-ADD,POLLFIRST,POLLLAST,DESCENDINGSET,HEADSET,TAILSET,SUBSET

@ IF YOU ARE DEPENDING ON THE DEFAULT NATURAL SORTING THEN COMPALSARY OBJECT SHOULD BE HOMOGENIOUS AND COMPARABLE
-HOW OBJECT SHOULD BE COMPARABLE BY IMPLEMENTING THE COMPARABLE INTERFACE.
-BY DEFAULT STRING AND WRAPPER CLASSES ARE COMPARABLE DEFAULT.


@ COMPARABLE(I)
-IT IS AN INTERFACE PRESENT IN JAVA.LANG.PKG AND IT CONTAIN ONLY ONE METHOD 
                              COMPARETO();
                              
 -OBJECT2.COMPARETO(OBJECT1)
 -IF OBJ2 COMES BEFORE OBJ1 THEN -
 - IF OBJ2 COMES AFTER OBJ1 THEN +
 -BOTH THE EQUALS THEN 0;
 -BEFORE ADDING OBJECT IN TREE SET JVM ALWAYS CALL compareTo METHOD FROM COMPARABLE.
 
 IF YOU DONT SATISFY WITH DEFAULT NATURAL SORTING OF COMPARABLE THEN YOU CAN DO CUSTOMIZED SORTING USING COMPARATOR  
 
 
 @ COMPARATOR     
 -IT IS PRESENT IN JAVA.UTIL.PKG AND IT CONTAIN TWO METHOD
 1)PUBLIC VOID COMPARE(OBJECT OBJ1,OBJECT OBJ2);
 2)PUBLIC BOOLEAN EQUALS(OBJECT OBJ);
 
 -OUT OF THAT TWO METHOD WE HAVE TO PROVIDE IMPLEMENTATION FOR ONLY COMPARE() BECZ EQUALS() ALL READY PRESENT IN OBJECT CLASS SO IT IS AVAILABLE
 TO US THROUGH INHERITANCE CONCEPT.
             
 -IF YOU WANT TO USE THE DEFAULT NATURAL SORTING OR CUSTOMIZE SORTING FOR STRINGBUFFER OBJECT THEN YOU CAN DO BY USING COMPARATOR                 
 -//if you want to use the heterogeneous object in tree set then use the 
//custom sorting order
