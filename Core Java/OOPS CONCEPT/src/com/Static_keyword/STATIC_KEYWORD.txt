Static keyword    

1)we can use static Keyword with
  static variable
  static method
  static block
  static nested classes

2)#static variable:

1)static variable only get memory in class area during the time of class loading only.
it will get memory only once in method area.
#normal variable get memory in the heap
  We can make instance variable as static but we can't make local variable as static
  class test
  {
  static int a=10;
  void show()
  {
  static int b=10;//compile time error inner local variable can't be static
  
  }
 #static variable belong to class not object
 if you want to call the a into main method we do not need to create object of
 test we can call by class name only
 s.o.p(test.a);
 #memory management is the main use of static variable.
 
 3)#STATIC METHOD()
 
 1)static method belong to class not an object.
 2)static method can be called direct if only one main class 
 have static method we can call directly without creating object.
 3)static method can only access static data as well as static method only .can
  not override non static method
  4)we can not use super or this keyword with static method
  5) we can overload the static method by different argument in method but we can not override the static method.
 6)a static variable can be used is not static method but static method only access the static variable.
  
 4)#STATIC BLOCK
 1)static block execute automatically when the calls is loaded
 2)static block can be execute without the main before java JDK version 1.6
 3)for native method loading (code which are on another language)
 4)if you want to declare static variable then we write in static block
