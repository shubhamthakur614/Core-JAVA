1)method overloading is compile time polymorphism.
2)method overriding is run time polymorphism

!!!!!!!!!!!!!OVERLOADING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters,
 it is known as METHOD OVERLOADING.

-If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods 
increases the READABILITY of the program.
 
 There are two ways to overload the method in java

 1)By changing number of arguments.
 2)By changing the data type.
 
 -In java we can not perform method overloading just by changing the return 
 type from 1.5v onWard.
 
 -TYPEPRAMOTION
 -if one is integer and one is double then the integer type promoted into 
 double.
 -but if we have two integer and two double then type promotion not happen .
 
 ****VVIMP
 -runtime polymorphism you cant achieve with the variables;
 EX:
  class Animal
  {
    String s="LION";
  }
  
  class Dog extends Animal
  { 
  String s="Dog";
  }
  
  class Test
  { 
  public static void main(String[]args)
  {
    Animal a=new DOg();upcasting
    System.out.println(a.s);//LION not dog
      }
  }
  -becz with the help of parent class object reference we can 
  hold child object but we can not access the child methods.
  
  -we can not reduce the scope of the method.
  -if we have static method in parent class and same static method in child class then we
  can override that method but this is not method overriding its method hiding.
  
  -Method Hiding
  -all rules of method hiding is same as that of the method overriding but following diff
  -
